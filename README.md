### Lab 1 - Create Moodbot with `rasa init`

- Open the `lab1.ipynb` workbook and step through the workbook
  - The first cell installs packages and starts the event loop
  - The `create_initial_project` call does the `rasa init` to create a new Rasa project
  - The next cell trains the model using the default moodbot training data
  - Run the last cell to talk to your bot, from the command line this is done with the `rasa shell` command
